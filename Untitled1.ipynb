    "Key factor for testable ideas: The key factor that distinguishes ideas that can be tested statistically is whether they can be measured and quantified with data. This means that the idea must be expressed in a form that allows us to collect relevant evidence and determine if it supports or refutes the claim.\n",

    "Difference between null and alternative hypotheses: The null hypothesis (H₀) represents the default or status quo assumption, typically suggesting no effect or no difference. The alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ) represents the claim or effect we are trying to detect, suggesting that there is an effect or difference. The goal of hypothesis testing is to use evidence (data) to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n",
